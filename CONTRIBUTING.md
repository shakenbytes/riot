# CONTRIBUTION

BE NICE!

All the contributions start with an issue. Since we depend on other people's availability, we want to make sure we are working on the most important things.

We usually go live on Twitch, but feel free to open a PR if you already got assigned to an issue.

## Run locally

### Install dependencies

We are using node js so you will have to install all the dependencies before running the project using:

```
npm install
```

*We are using nodemon for the development server*

### Run server in development mode
```
npm run dev
```

## Solving bugs

If you find a bug please create an issue and describe how to reproduce it. Also associate any PR you work on to that bug.


## Adding features

Before adding any features an issue needs to be created where the details of the feature need to be explain along with how to test it.
