Application Workflow Monitoring

The purpose of this project is to monitor business workflows and send notifications when something unexpected happens.

We want to able to track a business workflow from its initial state to the desired ending state. To do that, we have defined actions that change the status of the workflow using transitions.

Notifications will be triggered based on transition rules.
